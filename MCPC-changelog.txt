Changelog:

Build MCPC-1.4.5-beta-3
	blood
		Integrated Spigot build #290 into codeline. The biggest enhancement is Asynchronous Chunk I/O which should help boost
		TPS on server. Check bukkit.yml for new spigot configurations to optimize further.
		Fixed jline crashes when loading jar without --nojline.

Build MCPC-1.4.5-dev-2.3
	blood
		Fixed plugin issue when creating new worlds. Applied some CB fixes. Removed java.nio.file dependency. Cleaned up code.

Build MCPC-1.4.5-beta-2
	blood
		Repackaged guava 12 to fix compatibility issue with Bukkit
		
		In past releases of MCPC, many bukkit plugins have not worked correctly
		with MCPC since bukkit still uses guava 10 while Forge uses guava 12. 
		I have repackaged the guava 12 library to use a different package
		name to avoid conflicts. Forge will now use mcpc-guava-12.0.1.jar. 
		This should solve all the bukkit plugin issues with MCPC such as 
		Multiverse and Essentials which still use guava 10.

		Disabled jline so users can run server without '--nojline'

Build MCPC-1.4.5-beta-1
	blood
		initial release. Still much work to be done but it is guaranteed to work with MoCreatures 4.3.1
